Customer: Yes, my business is located in Dallas, state of Texas. Agent: Thank you, how can I help you today? Customer: I am relatively new to this process and currently do everything manually. Do you have any advice or tips on manual telephone billing processing? Agent: If you are a small business with few employees and have opted for manual billing, you will need to keep accurate records of employees and devices, among other details. You should also ensure that your calculations are correct and remember to submit all necessary proof on time. Customer: Thank you, that is quite helpful. Are there specific procedures I should follow? Agent: Certain aspects of billing processing are regulated by ANATEL. Some of the rules you must comply with include: Resolution number 717 and the General Telecommunications Law. Customer: That sounds very complicated. I really don't feel like managing all of this. Agent: If you would like, I can transfer you to one of our specialized agents who can talk to you about billing service providers who will help you manage all of this. Customer: Alright, thank you very much for all your help.
